## the need

We have received a number of requests for AI resources for teachers (i.e. not just student-facing resources that assume teachers already know what they want to do, or even what AI can do in their contexts).

A couple of folks have volunteered to be the initial target audience, so this repo will be a place where we can build materials and interactions designed just for them (2 or 3 instructors we know well) as we work to develop something more systematic.
